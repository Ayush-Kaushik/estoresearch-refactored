# Refactored eStoreSearch (Java Project)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a refactored version of my university Java project, originally designed as a simple console-based eStore search system. Over time, I restructured and improved the code to reflect best practices, better maintainability, and cleaner architecture.

> The goal was to modernize the codebase and demonstrate improved coding standards, readability, modularity, and extensibility.

## ðŸ”„ Refactoring Summary

| Aspect              | Old Version                                | Refactored Version                          |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Structure           | Monolithic, flat structure                 | Modular packages with separation of concerns|
| Naming              | Inconsistent, ambiguous names              | Clear, descriptive class and method names   |
| Code Duplication    | Repeated logic across classes              | Utility/helper methods introduced           |
| Enums/Constants     | Hard-coded strings                         | Type-safe enums with centralized constants  |
| Input Handling      | Inline logic with business logic           | Separated input logic into dedicated classes|
| Object-Oriented Use | Minimal encapsulation                      | Encapsulated fields, added polymorphism     |

## ðŸ§  Why the Refactor?

This project was originally built as part of a university course. The refactored version is a personal initiative to document my growth as a Java developer and designer.

- âœ… To improve **code readability** and make onboarding easier.
- âœ… To promote **clean architecture principles** (e.g., separation of concerns).
- âœ… To reduce **code duplication** and increase reusability.
- âœ… To introduce **testability** and future extensibility.
- âœ… To follow **Java best practices** (e.g., naming conventions, immutability, access modifiers).

## ðŸ†š Before vs. After
I will pick some sections and explain my reasoning behind the refactoring.

### ðŸ”¸ Example 1: TODO

**Before:**
```java
// add sample code
```

**After:**
```Java
// add sample code
```
